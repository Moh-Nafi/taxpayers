It is common practice for businesses to maintain employee records that include income tax information,
such as the employee's wages, tax withholdings, and any additional tax-related information required by tax authorities.

Possible Use Cases:
   1. Payroll Processing: Businesses need to calculate and withhold the correct amount of income tax from their 
      employees'paychecks based on their income, tax brackets, and any applicable deductions or credits.

   2. Tax Reporting: Employers are responsible for reporting their employees' income and 
      tax withholdings to tax authorities. This includes providing employees with Form W-2 in the United States or similar tax documents in other countries.

   3. Compliance: Keeping track of employee income tax information ensures that businesses comply with 
      tax laws and regulations. It helps businesses accurately calculate and remit the required tax amounts to tax authorities.

   4. Record Keeping: Maintaining records of employees' income tax information is important for auditing purposes 
      and can help resolve any discrepancies or questions that may arise during tax audits or investigations.
